Station: CHOPIN by Epic Piano (often listed as “Epic Piano – CHOPIN”). It is a Germany‑based, internet‑only stream devoted entirely to Frédéric Chopin’s piano works, programmed as an uninterrupted, announcer‑free music channel. The service sits within the Epic Piano Radio brand operated by RauteMusik GmbH; Epic Piano’s own site footer credits RauteMusik, and TuneIn lists the network as “RauteMusik Netzwerk.” ([epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/), [tunein.com](https://tunein.com/radio/CHOPIN-by-Epic-Piano-s310030/))

History and ownership: RauteMusik is a long‑running German web‑radio operator founded in 2003; in recent years it has extended its platform to power branded services such as Epic Piano. While a specific launch date for the Chopin stream isn’t published, Epic Piano’s website presents it as one of 11 curated piano playlists active by 2025. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RauteMusik.FM?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/))

Programming/style: As a single‑format stream, CHOPIN focuses on Nocturnes, Preludes, Waltzes, Ballades, Sonatas, and other core Chopin repertoire with no talk breaks (“ohne Moderation”), matching directory descriptions that emphasize non‑stop piano music. Third‑party playlist monitors show rotation examples such as Nocturne No. 5, Ballade No. 1, selections from Op. 25 Études, and the “Marche funèbre,” confirming a canonical, performance‑led mix. ([allradio.net](https://www.allradio.net/radio/31301?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [mytuner-radio.com](https://mytuner-radio.com/radio/epic-piano-chopin-487100/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Notable shows/hosts: There are no hosted programs or signature shows; the channel is a continuous, algorithmic/curated music stream. Multiple directories and Epic Piano’s own messaging highlight the absence of announcers and the “pure piano music” positioning. ([epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/), [allradio.net](https://www.allradio.net/radio/31301?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Streaming/coverage notes (United States): Listening is available worldwide via the Epic Piano web player (choose “Chopin”), and through aggregators including TuneIn, radio.net, myTuner, and the user‑supplied Internetradio‑Hören page. Radio.net’s app indicates CarPlay and Android Auto support, which is useful for in‑car listening. Some directories may display limited now‑playing metadata; for track identification, playlist loggers like radio.menu can help. One logger shows intermittent “beep adswizz” entries—this suggests ad‑insertion is occasionally used (inference based on those logs). ([epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/), [tunein.com](https://tunein.com/radio/CHOPIN-by-Epic-Piano-s310030/), [radio.net](https://www.radio.net/s/epicpiano-chopin?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [mytuner-radio.com](https://mytuner-radio.com/radio/epic-piano-chopin-487100/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [internetradio-horen.de](https://www.internetradio-horen.de/epic-piano-chopin), [radio.menu](https://radio.menu/stations/epic-piano-com-epic-piano-chopin/playlist/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Operating details/contact: Listings place the service in Cologne/North Rhine‑Westphalia, Germany. Public contact lines associated with the brand in directories include a RauteMusik email (jp@rm.fm) and an operations contact through UPLINK Digital GmbH (a German transmission services firm) shown on TuneIn. For official ownership, rely on Epic Piano’s site footer referencing RauteMusik GmbH.

ABC Radio Sydney (call sign 2BL) is the ABC’s flagship local station for Greater Sydney. It broadcasts on 702 kHz AM at 50 kW and on DAB+ in the Sydney market; live streaming is via the ABC listen website. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001183435-Which-ABC-radio-stations-can-I-listen-to-on-DAB-Digital-Radio/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/live/sydney))

History and evolution
- Launched in Sydney on November 13, 1923 as 2SB; soon renamed 2BL. It joined the government‑owned Australian Broadcasting Commission network in 1932. The on‑air “2BL” identity was phased out to “702 ABC Sydney” in 1999 and to “ABC Radio Sydney” in 2017. The station marked its centenary in November 2023 by retiring the hourly “pips.” ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Operations moved from Ultimo to new studios at Parramatta Square: first radio shows began broadcasting from there in May 2024; the facility was officially opened on February 18, 2025. Mornings was the first ABC Radio Sydney program to air from Parramatta. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/about/media-centre/press-releases/abc-parramatta-officially-opens/103901598?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Ownership
- Owned and operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australia’s national public broadcaster. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Notable shows and hosts (current and recent)
- Breakfast: Craig Reucassel (local). Afternoons: James Valentine. Drive: Chris Bath (Mon–Thu), Dom Knight (Fri). Evenings: Renée Krosch. Networked late nights: Nightlife (Philip Clark/Suzanne Hill) and Overnights. Schedule runs local news/current affairs with some Radio National programs in mid‑day. Times are Sydney time (AEST/AEDT). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Mornings: Hamish Macdonald hosts Monday–Thursday; Kathryn Robinson on Fridays. The show airs 8:30–11:00am Sydney time and is available for catch‑up in the ABC listen archive. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/sydney-mornings), [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jan/14/hamish-macdonald-new-host-abc-sydney-mornings-radio-program?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Past high‑profile presenters include Andrew Olle, Mike Carlton, Angela Catterns, Adam Spencer, Deborah Cameron, Simon Marnie, and Sarah Macdonald. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Coverage and transmission
- Primary frequency 702 AM with a 50 kW transmitter serving Greater Sydney and the Blue Mountains; ABC has identified the transmission mast location as Liverpool in maintenance notices. DAB+ carries “ABC Radio Sydney” in the Sydney digital multiplex. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/sydney/abc-sydney-transmitter-outage/101469448?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001183435-Which-ABC-radio-stations-can-I-listen-to-on-DAB-Digital-Radio?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Streaming and access notes (useful from the US)
- The live stream on the ABC listen website is generally available worldwide; however, some programming (especially sport and certain music performances) may be replaced or hidden outside Australia due to rights. The ABC listen mobile app is typically restricted to Australian App Store/Google Play accounts, but the web stream works internationally. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/5974190778639-How-can-I-access-ABC-services-overseas?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Current status (as of August 26, 2025)
- Operating from Parramatta studios with full local schedule; Mornings with Hamish Macdonald is active and publishing daily episodes; the live page for ABC Sydney confirms current playout and upcoming program blocks. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/104951168?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

=== AI on ABC Radio Sydney NSW ===
ABC Radio Sydney is the ABC’s Sydney local station and one of Australia’s foundational services. It began on November 13, 1923 as 2SB, soon became 2BL, and was folded into the national ABC network in 1932; it has since broadcast primarily as a news/talk service for Sydney and surrounds. 

Ownership and governance: ABC Radio Sydney is operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australia’s national public broadcaster and a statutory authority governed by the ABC Act. 

Frequency, coverage and platforms: The station transmits on 702 kHz AM (50 kW), serves Greater Sydney and the Blue Mountains, and is also available on DAB+ digital radio in Sydney. Listeners can stream via the ABC listen website; the ABC listen app can be downloaded only with Australian Apple/Google IDs, and some programs (often sport) may be unavailable outside Australia due to rights. 

Transmitter/site: ABC maintenance notices identify the primary 702 AM mast at Liverpool, NSW; work periods have temporarily interrupted overnight AM service in the past, with alternatives on DAB+ and streaming. 

Studios and current status (as of August 26, 2025): ABC Radio Sydney began broadcasting from ABC Parramatta (6–8 Parramatta Square) in May 2024; the new facility was officially opened in February 2025 by the Prime Minister and ABC leadership. The move is part of the ABC’s strategy to strengthen local presence in Western Sydney. 

Notable shows/hosts now: Breakfast with Craig Reucassel (5:30–8:00), AM with Sabra Lane (8:00–8:30), and Mornings with Hamish Macdonald (Mon–Thu) and Kathryn Robinson (Fri), 8:30–11:00. Afternoons is with James Valentine; Drive is with Chris Bath (Mon–Thu) and Dom Knight (Fri). Evenings, Nightlife and Overnights follow. The Mornings program aims to keep Sydney informed and engaged with local stories, politics and listener discussion—matching your note about tone and purpose. 

Heritage notes: ABC Radio Sydney marked its centenary in November 2023 and retired the traditional hourly “pips” locally during the celebrations—an emblematic shift toward digital-first listening. 

Streaming reliability: ABC upgraded its radio streaming platform in February 2025 to underpin streams across website, apps, third‑party services, smart speakers and internet radios.

Station overview
ABC Radio National (RN) is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s national ideas network, carrying news, current affairs, arts, science, religion and ethics programming across Australia on AM/FM, DAB+ and online. It serves as a forum for in‑depth conversations and specialist shows, with live and on‑demand listening via the ABC listen platform.

History
RN traces back to Sydney station 2FC: test transmissions on December 5, 1923, followed by regular broadcasts from January 9, 1924. After the ABC formed in 1932, the network later became “ABC Radio 2” and adopted the “Radio National” name in 1985. The network marked its centenary on December 5, 2023. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-05/history-listen-on-radio-national-s-100-year-anniversary/103176804?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Station: Papageno Rádió (Hungary) — an online classical/arts stream operated under the broader Papageno cultural media brand. The Papageno group is a leading Hungarian cultural platform (print, web, live streaming) run by Papageno Consulting Kft.; its team also produces two weekly programs on Budapest’s Klasszik Rádió 92.1 (“Capriccio” and “Papageno Klasszik”), separate from this internet-only station. ([about.papageno.hu](https://about.papageno.hu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [news.imz.at](https://news.imz.at/industry-news/news/papageno-11320694/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Format and programming: Papageno Rádió programs classical music, opera, and some jazz around the clock, with artist- and theme-led blocks. Descriptions and contact information list the operator as Papageno Consulting Kft. (Budapest, Somlói út 33/A; radio@papageno.hu). ([radiok.hu](https://radiok.hu/papageno-radio/))

History/highlights: The stream has been active at least since January 2020, when Papageno announced the launch of “Lakatlan sziget” (Desert Island) as a new thematic series, scheduled Tuesdays 22:00 with repeats Thursdays 15:00 and Saturdays 16:00 (times as published in January 2020, CET). Other branded strands include “Portré” (artist portraits; Mondays 15:00, with repeats Wednesday 22:00 and Friday 14:00) and, from October 1, 2020, “Lemezújdonság” (recent-recording feature; Tuesdays 15:00, repeat Thursday 22:00). Seasonal and special-event blocks have included a New Year’s holiday lineup (e.g., Strauss: Die Fledermaus on December 31, and Haydn: The Creation on January 1). ([papageno.hu](https://papageno.hu/zene/2020/01/tematikus-musorral-jelentkezik-a-papageno-radio/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

What you’ll hear: A mix of canonical orchestral/operatic repertoire and Hungarian performers alongside period ensembles and international orchestras. Third‑party playlist logs regularly show entries such as Rossini overtures, Bach Brandenburg concerti, Mendelssohn and Beethoven symphonic movements, and works led by conductors like Nikolaus Harnoncourt—consistent with what you noted.

Streaming/coverage notes (United States listener): Papageno Rádió is an internet-only service; there is no published FM/AM frequency. Listening is available worldwide via Papageno’s pages and Hungarian radio aggregators (e.g., Radiok.hu, OnlineRadioK/OnlineRadioBox). Mobile app access for Android and iOS was promoted in Papageno posts in 2020; availability and links may have changed since, but the stream remains accessible via web players. If a given aggregator fails to load, try another or the official Papageno site.

Klassik Radio (Germany) is a privately owned, commercial classical network best known for a listener‑friendly mix of classical hits, film music, and lighter “new classics.” It began broadcasting on October 28, 1990; some trade coverage lists October 15, 1991, but the German record shows 1990 as the launch. The brand has been led since a late‑1990s turnaround by CEO Ulrich R. J. Kubak, whose Klassik Radio AG took the company public in 2004. The broadcaster’s corporate headquarters moved to Augsburg in October 2021, with studio operations historically tied to Hamburg. 

Programming emphasizes single movements rather than full works—aimed at relaxed, all‑day listening. Since winter 2024 the station runs concise top‑of‑hour news briefings between 06:00 and 10:00, replacing the prior all‑day hourly newscasts. Featured presenters have included tenor Rolando Villazón, TV/radio personality Thomas Ohrner, and jazz trumpeter Till Brönner, alongside Alexandra Berger and others. 

Distribution and coverage: Klassik Radio pivoted decisively to digital. It is carried nationwide in Germany on DAB+ (block 5C) and is also available via DAB+ in Austria (since May 2019) and in German‑speaking Switzerland (since May 2021). Many FM allocations outside major cities were switched off on September 1, 2015, and the company later sold a tranche of FM frequencies (2017) to fund digital expansion—so FM availability today is limited and region‑specific, while DAB+ and online are primary. 

Streaming: Worldwide listening is available free via the web stream; Klassik Radio Select, launched December 14, 2017, offers ad‑free listening and 150–180 expertly curated stations (classical, film, jazz, lounge), typically at up to 320 kbit/s. XPLR reports Select reached break‑even in 2022. The live service is also accessible through third‑party platforms such as TuneIn and radio.de. For convenience, the user‑supplied page (internetradio-horen.de) embeds the live stream and track data, but for the most reliable stream and channel lineup use the official site or the Select apps. 

Notable franchise: Klassik Radio live in Concert—annual tours featuring the 80‑piece Klassik Radio Pops Orchestra conducted by Nic Raine—extends the brand into concert halls and recordings.

Zeitlose Kompositionen des Popstars der Klassik.

AI Generated Content:
Station overview
Klassik Radio Mozart (often listed as “Klassik Radio Pure Mozart”) is a curated web stream in the Klassik Radio family from Germany. It plays continuous Mozart recordings and is typically presented without announcers; directory and platform pages describe it as “Zeitlose Kompositionen des Popstars der Klassik” and display now‑playing metadata but no published program grid. ([internetradio-horen.de](https://www.internetradio-horen.de/klassik-radio-pure-mozart), [radioplayer.de](https://www.radioplayer.de/radio/klassik-radio-mozart.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Ownership and background
The channel sits under Klassik Radio, a private German network on air since October 28, 1990, owned by the publicly listed Klassik Radio AG (Augsburg; studios also in Hamburg). Leadership has included Ulrich R. J. Kubak and Tina Jäger. The main network expanded nationwide via DAB+ from August 1, 2011, and its online portfolio grew with the launch of the subscription streaming service Klassik Radio Select on December 14, 2017 (now offering 180+ themed streams). The Mozart stream is part of this themed‑channel ecosystem. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klassik_Radio?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klassik_Radio_AG?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ebu.ch](https://www.ebu.ch/news/2011/germany-launches-nationwide-dab?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Programming notes
Klassik Radio’s editorial approach emphasizes accessible listening: selected movements/excerpts rather than complete works, and it blends core classics with film music and “New Classics.” That philosophy informs the Mozart stream, which cycles well‑known symphonic, concerto and chamber movements rather than full multi‑movement works. On the parent network, well‑known presenters have included Holger Wemhoff and Till Brönner, though the Mozart web stream itself is normally music‑only. ([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klassik_Radio?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Streaming and coverage
For listeners in the United States, this is an online‑only service; there is no U.S. terrestrial carriage. You can stream via Klassik Radio’s web player and via Radioplayer apps and integrations (smart speakers, Sonos/Bose, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto). If a directory page lacks artwork or listing data, Radioplayer’s station page typically shows the logo and “now playing.” The parent network is carried on DAB+ in Germany (and later in Austria/Switzerland), and in 2021 Klassik Radio launched its movie‑music spinoff nationally on Germany’s second commercial DAB+ multiplex; the Mozart channel remains a web stream. ([radioplayer.de](https://www.radioplayer.de/radio/klassik-radio-mozart.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klassik_Radio?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [worlddab.org](https://www.worlddab.org/news/11866/germany%27s-klassik-radio-launches-nationwide-on-dab%2B?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Audio quality and metadata
Free streams are ad‑supported; Klassik Radio Select offers ad‑free HD listening (up to 320 kbit/s) across its themed channels for subscribers. Availability is generally worldwide, though access is always subject to rights or platform restrictions. ([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klassik_Radio?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Epic Piano - CHOPIN Live
24/7 Piano Music
 
No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
Epic Piano’s CHOPIN channel is a dedicated, nonstop piano stream built around Chopin’s works. It sits within the broader Epic Piano family, a RauteMusik-brand station that curates several piano-centric playlists. The channel is marketed as 24/7 piano music and is accessible in Germany (Cologne) and worldwide via streaming platforms. The official Epic Piano site presents 11 piano playlists, including CHOPIN, ROMANTIC PIANO, SOLO PIANO, and PIANO COVERHITS, underscoring the brand’s focus on instrumental piano repertoires. ([internetradio-horen.de](https://www.internetradio-horen.de/epic-piano-chopin), [epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/))

History and ownership. Epic Piano is a RauteMusik project; RauteMusik (RM/FM) is a long-running German internet radio network started in 2003 and expanded to dozens of channels. Epic Piano is part of this ecosystem, with the Epic Piano pages listing “RauteMusik GmbH” as the operator and © 2025 as the current year on the site. This places CHOPIN within a mature, Germany-based streaming group that distributes content globally via web radio partners. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RauteMusik.FM?utm_source=openai), [epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/), [de.m.wikipedia.org](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RauteMusik?utm_source=openai))

Channel specifics. The CHOPIN Live page on the RauteMusik/Hören directory explicitly shows “Epic Piano - CHOPIN Live” with the label “24/7 Piano Music” and the city listing Köln, Germany, indicating the channel’s origin within the RauteMusik network. The listing links to the official Epic Piano site (epic-piano.com), reinforcing that CHOPIN is a dedicated playlist within a larger, host-free streaming brand. Multiple third-party aggregators also present CHOPIN by Epic Piano as a nonstop Chopin-piano stream, often without announcers. ([internetradio-horen.de](https://www.internetradio-horen.de/epic-piano-chopin), [epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/), [radio.net](https://www.radio.net/s/epicpiano-chopin?utm_source=openai), [tunein.com](https://tunein.com/radio/CHOPIN-by-Epic-Piano-s310030/?utm_source=openai))

Programming and format. The CHOPIN channel is described as “24/7 Piano Music” with a Chopin emphasis; the Epic Piano site confirms 11 piano playlists, including CHOPIN, demonstrating a structured catalog rather than a single live show. The absence of show hosts is typical for these channels, which are designed for focused instrumental listening rather than spoken word. The official Epic Piano hub (epic-piano.com) lists CHOPIN among its playlists alongside other composers and moods, aligning with the brand’s pure-instrumental presentation. ([internetradio-horen.de](https://www.internetradio-horen.de/epic-piano-chopin), [epic-piano.com](https://epic-piano.com/))

Streaming/coverage notes. Availability is global via internet streams and radio directories; CHOPIN by Epic Piano is listed on platforms like TuneIn, radio.net, and AllRadio, indicating broad distribution beyond the RauteMusik site itself. The RauteMusik network’s own footprint, including its 40+ streams and international reach, provides the framework for cross-platform accessibility of CHOPIN. For researchers, the key dates and ownership are rooted in RauteMusik’s 2003 origin and RauteMusik GmbH’s current branding. ([tunein.com](https://tunein.com/radio/CHOPIN-by-Epic-Piano-s310030/?utm_source=openai), [radio.at](https://www.radio.at/s/epicpiano-chopin?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RauteMusik.FM?utm_source=openai), [de.m.wikipedia.org](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RauteMusik?utm_source=openai))

Papageno Rádió is the online arm of Papageno, a Budapest-based cultural platform that curates classical music, opera, and jazz for Hungarian and international audiences. The station streams 24/7 and positions itself as both a familiar shelf and a discovery engine for listeners seeking concert-hall quality in a home-stream format. The Papageno outlet emphasizes a curated mix—masterworks alongside contemporary pieces—with artist portraits and interviews threaded into its programming. Direct streaming is available via papageno.hu/papageno-radio, and the station is listed on onlineradiok.org as “Papageno online” under Budapest with a link back to Papageno’s site. ([about.papageno.hu](https://about.papageno.hu/hu/about-us-main/?utm_source=openai), [papageno.hu](https://papageno.hu/papageno-radio/?utm_source=openai), [onlineradiok.org](https://www.onlineradiok.org/papageno))

Ownership and corporate footprint: Papageno Rádió operates under Papageno Consulting Kft. and is physically connected to Papageno’s broader culture platform, with a Budapest address at 1118 Budapest, Somlói út 33/A. This alignment with Papageno’s publishing and live-streaming ventures places the radio within a multi-pronged media brand focused on classical music, theater, and arts journalism. ([radiok.hu](https://radiok.hu/papageno-radio/?utm_source=openai), [about.papageno.hu](https://about.papageno.hu/hu/about-us-main/?utm_source=openai))

Notable shows and hosts: The station’s musical heart lies in Papageno Klasszik and Capriccio, two ongoing programs that mix performances, artist interviews, and cultural information. Papageno Klasszik features a rotating slate of Hungarian and international guest artists and presenters, including names such as Balázs János, Haumann Máté, Harcsa Veronika, Enyedi Éva, Horváth Zsolt, and others in various episodes. Capriccio functions as a talk-and-mellow-arts showcase with guests and curated repertoire. The Capriccio program traces lineage back to early Hungarian classical radio from 2003 and has persisted in different formats, including involvement with Klasszik Rádió. Papageno has collaborated with Klasszik Rádió 92.1 as a bridge for these formats; in 2009, Papageno’s CEO was among the founders of Klasszik Rádió, reflecting a deep connect between Papageno and classical radio in Hungary. ([papageno.hu](https://papageno.hu/papageno-radio/?utm_source=openai))

Historical context and brand ecosystem: Papageno.hu began as Hungary’s cultural portal and expanded into a broader ecosystem that includes Papageno Live (live streaming services for events), Papageno Magazine, and joint ventures such as Papageno Klasszik & Capriccio. The company’s public-facing history states that Klasszik & Capriccio are integral to its radio offerings, and the brand has sustained a long-running presence in Budapest’s classical music scene, interlinking media, performance venues, and publishing. This history helps explain Papageno Rádió’s continued emphasis on artist portraits, interviews, and cultural features alongside steady musical programming. ([about.papageno.hu](https://about.papageno.hu/?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and coverage notes: In addition to direct streaming on Papageno’s own site, Papageno Rádió is permeable to distribution through partner platforms and radio directories. The Onlineradiok.org Papageno page confirms the station’s online presence and lists Papageno’s site as the main hub; the page also shows Papageno’s city labeling and a direct link to Papageno’s site, underscoring its trans-platform accessibility. The station’s app presence is also documented (Papageno Radio App), and streaming options appear across Radioguide.fm and Openradio.app. The combination supports 24/7 listening with cross-platform discoverability.

AI Generated Content:
EHFM is Edinburgh’s online community radio project, launched in 2018 by local DJs seeking a platform beyond nightlife to broaden representation and build a community around music and discussion. The station bills itself as a 24/7 online service with a broad programming approach and on-demand access to shows via its site. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHFM?utm_source=openai))

EHFM’s early years saw it based at the Summerhall arts venue in central Edinburgh, where it operated for about six years. In 2024, the operation moved to Ground Floor, a public-facing cafe and studio complex in Leith, signaling a closer integration with the local community and a new model for audience interaction during broadcasts. The move was widely covered by local and industry outlets, noting the public-facing studio and cafe concept designed to fund the station. ([theedinburghreporter.co.uk](https://theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2024/07/ehfm-open-new-studio/?utm_source=openai))

Programming at EHFM runs continuously online, with a mix of live and pre-recorded content. Shows are typically 1–2 hours and the station maintains a robust on-demand archive on its website, aligning with the broader online community radio ethos. This structure has been described in multiple overviews of the station’s format and reach. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHFM?utm_source=openai))

Funding and governance are notable aspects of EHFM. The station operates a Patreon subscription model (described as a three-tier system) while also using cafe profits from Ground Floor to support its activities, illustrating a diversified community-finance approach common to station-run nonprofits. These elements are documented in both the station’s own materials and in coverage of its 2024 relocation. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHFM?utm_source=openai))

Notable people and the station’s broader ethos are captured in media coverage. Clash Magazine reported EHFM’s move to Ground Floor and quoted co-founder and director Jamie Pettinger, underscoring the leadership and the station’s community-first focus. The roster of presenters is described as diverse, including local DJs, journalists, and labels, reflecting EHFM’s aim to foster local talent. ([clashmusic.com](https://www.clashmusic.com/news/edinburgh-community-radio-station-ehfm-launches-new-cafe-studio/?utm_source=openai))

The Ground Floor move has also been framed as a public-facing evolution, with outlets like The Edinburgh Reporter and RadioToday highlighting the café-studio concept and public interaction with broadcasts in Leith. This aligns with EHFM’s stated goal of expanding audience engagement and providing a space where listeners can observe and participate in real time. ([theedinburghreporter.co.uk](https://theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2024/07/ehfm-open-new-studio/?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and online presence remain central to EHFM. The station streams via ehfm.live, with mobile apps and social-media clips feeding a growing archive (including SoundCloud uploads), reinforcing accessibility for listeners both locally and globally. The EHFM page, the Radio-UK listing, and SoundCloud activity corroborate this multi-channel approach. ([radio-uk.co.uk](https://www.radio-uk.co.uk/ehfm?utm_source=openai))

Radio Alternativa is the community-anchored radio initiative associated with Casa de la Mujer Bolivia, based in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. It operates as a feminist, rights-focused broadcaster with a mission to empower women, indigenous communities, and urban peripheries through talk, information, and cultural programming. Public references place the station on the Santa Cruz scene as a locally rooted, socially oriented outlet. Frequency and public presence point to 103.0 FM in Santa Cruz, with informal online content (e.g., program segments) shared via SoundCloud. ([casadelamujer.org.bo](https://casadelamujer.org.bo/index.php/radio?utm_source=openai))

History and identity
Radio Alternativa emerged as the radio arm of Casa de la Mujer, a Santa Cruz feminist organization founded in 1990. The station first aired on October 11, 1998, described as an “alternativa/alter-activa” platform designed to amplify voices of women, indigenous groups, and peri-urban communities. The organization frames the station as a deliberate tool for democratizing speech, advancing human rights, and challenging patriarchal norms within Bolivia’s pluricultural context. The Casa de la Mujer’s public materials outline this long-running mission and its reach across the Santa Cruz area. ([casadelamujer.org.bo](https://casadelamujer.org.bo/index.php/radio?utm_source=openai))

Ownership, mission, and reach
Radio Alternativa is presented by Casa de la Mujer as a core component of its broader social mandate. The station’s stated vision and medical of empowerment emphasize gender equality, intercultural inclusion, and the prevention of gender-based violence, aligning with the organization’s broader programs and advocacy. Additional materials indicate the network’s claimed regional reach—about 30 kilometers around Santa Cruz—highlighting its role as a community broadcaster rather than a commercial operation. ([casadelamujer.org.bo](https://casadelamujer.org.bo/?utm_source=openai))

Notable shows, hosts, and programming
Radio Alternativa’s programming profile emphasizes a mix of information, community reporting, and cultural content, with several named programs and hosts:

- Sin Fronteras: information-driven slot anchored by Joaquín Matías Vaca (SCZ), with networked inputs from ERBOL and satellite feed sources. 
- Bolivia en Contacto: a nationwide-news format with a cross-city team (Ramiro García, Augusto Peña, Joaquín Matías, Deysi Ponce, Jesús Cardozo) contributing from their locales (CBBA, LPZ, SCZ, Chuq, TJ).
- La Tarde en Directo: afternoon magazine hosted by Pamela Moreno and Jhonny Escobar (Dj. Fax) focusing on culture, sports, tech, and interviews.
- Mujeres en Acción: a program dedicated to women’s issues, hosted by Miriam Suarez (Miércoles slot).

These program notes appear on Casa de la Mujer’s materials and local histories of Radio Alternativa, reflecting the station’s emphasis on gender, social justice, and community debate. ([casadelamujersantacruz.wordpress.com](https://casadelamujersantacruz.wordpress.com/radio-alternatvia/?utm_source=openai))

Streaming, access, and coverage notes
Public streaming for Radio Alternativa is not prominently advertised on the official site; the station is described primarily as a 103.0 FM signal serving Santa Cruz with a ~30 km radius. Content and segments appear in online formats (notably SoundCloud) as examples of produced programs, but there is no widely publicized, single-stream live feed linked from the main Casa de la Mujer pages. This pattern—strong local FM presence with ancillary online content—fits a community station model focused on local impact rather than nationwide online distribution. ([casadelamujer.org.bo](https://casadelamujer.org.bo/index.php/radio?utm_source=openai))

- Identity: Radio Alternativa, the Casa de la Mujer Bolivia radio arm, Santa Cruz, 103.0 FM, community-focused.

No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
KYFR Family Radio is the Shenandoah, Iowa AM outlet on 920 kHz, part of the
Family Radio network. Public records show KYFR is licensed to Family Stations,
Inc., with the main studio listed in Franklin, Tennessee (4057 Rural Plains Circle,
Suite 300B, Franklin, TN 37064). The station operates as a non-commercial religious
broadcaster within the Family Radio system. ([publicfiles.fcc.gov](https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/am-profile/kyfr?utm_source=openai))

History and lineage: The 920 AM frequency in Shenandoah was originally KFNF, a seed‑company
station operated by Henry Field Seed Co. In the 1970s KFNF was acquired by Family
Radio and became KYFR, bringing the network’s religious programming to the region.
This KFNF-to-KYFR transition is documented by radio historians noting the retirement
of KFNF and the arrival of Family Radio on KYFR. ([fybush.com](https://www.fybush.com/site-011024.html))

Ownership and market context: The Shenandoah cluster has a rich local radio lineage tied
to the Earl May Seed Company (KMA) and Henry Field Seed Co. Public histories note that
the KFNF/KYFR shift occurred in the 1970s, and that the May family’s Shenandoah assets
were later sold in December 2019 (the sale involved the Shenandoah group; KYFR itself
remained a Family Radio outlet). This sale is cited in the KMA history article, which
references KYFR’s existence as the post‑KFNF occupant. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMA_%28AM%29))

Technical/coverage notes: KYFR’s license is for 920 kHz with daytime power around 5 kW
and nighttime power about 2.5 kW (class B AM service). A 2022 Iowa Media News item notes
KYFR operating at reduced daytime power due to equipment issues, but the station’s licensed
parameters remain the 5 kW day/2.5 kW night configuration when conditions permit. Contour
maps and FCC materials confirm the Shenandoah site and the Franklin, TN address for the
license holder. ([iowamedianews.com](https://iowamedianews.com/2022-archive/?utm_source=openai))

Programming and hosts: KYFR carries the Family Radio network schedule, a Christian
teaching format originating in KEAR/San Francisco and distributed nationwide by Family
Stations, Inc. The network emphasizes Calvinist teaching and religious programming, with
historical programs like Open Forum hosted by Harold Camping; after Camping’s era and
the network’s 2010s changes, Family Radio continued with Bible teaching programs and
companions from notable theologians (RC Sproul, Alistair Begg, Ken Ham, John MacArthur, etc.)
as part of the network’s long-running lineup. The network’s programming is described in
summary by Family Radio and related sources as primarily teaching and worship content. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio))

Streaming and access: KYFR is listed on the Family Radio network’s site, and the feed is
accessible via familyradio.org. Third‑party aggregators also present KYFR’s stream, such as
the fmradiofree listing for KYFR on 920 AM Shenandoah. Listeners can typically use the
Family Radio “Listen Live” option or the affiliate streams to hear KYFR online. ([publicfiles.fcc.gov](https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/am-profile/kyfr?utm_source=openai))

In short, KYFR is a long‑standing Family Radio AM outlet whose identity reflects the classic
KFNF/KYFR Shenandoah rivalry turned network affiliation, with official Family Radio programming
and online streaming that ties back to the network’s Franklin, Tennessee base and broader
national ministry. ([fybush.com](https://www.fybush.com/site-011024.html))

AI Generated Content:
Totally Radio 70s is the Australian digital channel devoted to 1970s hits and classic oldies, run by Totally Media Pty. Ltd. It sits within the Totally Radio family, a multi-channel streaming network that markets “10 channels of music” with a DJ-light, mostly music-forward approach. The station is publicly listed as online-only across Australia, with apps and websites enabling worldwide access. Its branding emphasizes a light, humorous vibe rather than long-form announcer talk. ([totallymedia.com.au](https://totallymedia.com.au/?utm_source=openai))

History and ownership
- Launch and format: Totally Radio 70s appears to have launched around 2016 as part of the Totally Radio suite. Multiple independent listings cite 2016 as the first air date for Totally Radio 70s, aligning with the network’s expansion into decade-based streams. ([australian-radio.com](https://australian-radio.com/totally-radio-70s?utm_source=openai))
- Corporate ownership: The network is owned and operated by Totally Media Pty. Ltd., an Australian company based in Camp Hill, Queensland (4152). The Impressum on the Totally Radio site confirms the corporate structure and address. ([totallyradio.com.au](https://totallyradio.com.au/impressum/?utm_source=openai))
- Network context: Totally Media positions Totally Radio as its flagship pure-play streaming service, stressing “10 channels of music” and minimal talk from announcers, with 60s, 70s, 80s, and other channels in the family. This parent-brand description provides the broader context for Totally Radio 70s. ([totallymedia.com.au](https://totallymedia.com.au/?utm_source=openai))

Programming and notable shows/hosts
- Format and approach: Totally Radio 70s is described as “Just for Hits & Giggles,” reflecting a music-first, DJ-lite presentation. The broader network emphasizes a non-stop music format with limited on-air chatter, which shapes the 70s channel as a soundscape of era-appropriate hits rather than heavyweight hosted programs. ([radio-australia.org](https://www.radio-australia.org/totally-radio-70s))
- Hosts: There is no consistently documented, publicly published roster of hosts or notable hosts specifically for Totally Radio 70s. The station’s public-facing materials emphasize music and branding rather than biographical host profiles. This aligns with the company’s “no waffling announcers” posture across channels. ([totallymedia.com.au](https://totallymedia.com.au/?utm_source=openai))
- Representative music and artists: The channel’s current top-song snapshots include 70s and late-70s/early-80s staples from artists such as Gary Numan, Roxy Music, Boz Scaggs, The Kinks, and Peter Frampton, illustrating a broad 1970s-into-disco-pop blend rather than a single genre niche. ([radio-australia.org](https://www.radio-australia.org/totally-radio-70s))

Streaming, coverage, and accessibility
- Streaming model: Totally Radio 70s is streamed online and is available across all Australian states online; fans outside Australia can access it via the web and mobile apps. App download options are visible on listing pages, indicating iOS and Android availability. ([radio-australia.org](https://www.radio-australia.org/totally-radio-70s))
- Coverage notes: The station is part of a nationwide online initiative; there are no FM/AM frequencies listed for Totally Radio 70s. The broader Totally Radio family provides access through its own site and app ecosystem, with additional sister channels such as Totally Radio Hits, 60s, 80s, Greatest Hits, and more. ([radio-australia.org](https://www.radio-australia.org/totally-radio-70s))
- Site and branding: The official Totally Radio domain presents multiple decade-specific channels, with the 70s channel clearly positioned among other era-based streams; the site confirms the Camp Hill base and contact details via Impressum. ([radio-australia.org](https://www.radio-australia.org/totally-radio-70s))

Selected listening snapshot
- The Top Songs list (recent 7–30 days) reflects familiar 70s and early 80s staples: Cars, Lola, Lowdown, Brass in Pocket, Dancing Away, and related tracks. This reinforces a curated 70s/retro-pop mix rather than a strictly canonical “classic rock” or “oldies” playbill. ([radio-australia.org](https://www.radio-australia.org/totally-radio-70s))

Samantha Donovan

AI Generated Content:
ABC North and West SA is one of ABC Local Radio’s regional services in South Australia. It is based in Port Pirie and serves the North and West regions of SA with a mix of local programming and network relays from ABC Adelaide when not producing its own content. The station is part of the ABC’s state-wide SA footprint and maintains a strong presence in regional community life. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/northandwest/?utm_source=openai))

Historical snapshot
- The station traces to 5CK in Port Pirie, officially opened on 15 March 1932 as a relay of 5CL Adelaide, among ABC’s early regional outlets. The analogue era saw a long history of engineering upgrades, including a purpose-built studio complex opened in 1988. These landmarks anchor the station’s legacy in SA broadcasting. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_North_and_West_SA?utm_source=openai))
- In the late 1980s the Port Pirie studios were completed (opening date October 20, 1988), marking a major upgrade in local production facilities. Since then, ABC North and West SA has balanced local programming with Adelaide-originated network content. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_North_and_West_SA?utm_source=openai))

Local programming and notable hosts
- Historically, the station ran four local programs weekly: North and West Rural Report, Breakfast, Mornings, and Saturday Breakfast, with local hosts including Tom Mann (Breakfast) and Angela Smallcombe (Mornings). These roles illustrate the station’s emphasis on rural, regional and community topics. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_North_and_West_SA?utm_source=openai))
- In addition to daytime local shows, ABC North and West SA participates in the broader ABC Radio Adelaide relay when local production is not in progress, a common pattern for regional ABC Local Radio stations. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/northandwest/?utm_source=openai))

Streaming, coverage and access
- Live streaming is available via the ABC Listen platform: the page for ABC North and West SA Live Audio provides the current on-air schedule and the “Listen live” button. This makes the station accessible beyond its terrestrial frequencies. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/live/northandwest?utm_source=openai))
- The “Listen Back” feature on the same station page offers recent local news and feature segments, allowing on-demand listening of past content. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/northandwest/listenback?utm_source=openai))
- Coverage includes a broad reach across the North and West SA region, with listed relay towns and frequencies across Eyre Peninsula and nearby towns (e.g., Port Pirie 639 AM; other Eyre/Southern SA areas via FM/AM relays). ABC lists these as the operational reach for listeners around the coast and interior SA. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/northandwest/?utm_source=openai))

Notable modern programming and cross-overs
- The PM program, hosted nationwide by Samantha Donovan, is part of ABC Listen and Radio networks and features current affairs analysis; while PM is a national program, Samantha Donovan’s ABC bio notes her long-standing role across AM/PM and World Today; the PM pages show her as presenter. This reflects how ABC Local Radio programs interweave with national news coverage. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/pm?utm_source=openai))

Summary table
Feature | Description
Launch / Identity        | ABC Local Radio based in Port Pirie, serving North & West SA region

Contacto 4 Regiones en vivo
 
No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
The station known as Contacto 4 Regiones, also appearing as La Voz 4 Regiones in some listings, operates as an internet radio service focused on the San Luis Potosí region of Mexico. It is accessible via the live stream listed on Radio En Vivo (la-voz-4-regiones) and is catalogued in multiple radio directories as an online-only station with a regional emphasis. The public-facing page shows a live player labeled Contacto 4 Regiones en vivo, with a San Luis Potosí online frequency and contact details (phone and email). ([radio-en-vivo.mx](https://www.radio-en-vivo.mx/la-voz-4-regiones))

History and positioning
- The earliest verifiable public entry appears on Zeno FM with an “Announcement” entry dated September 6, 2022, describing La Voz 4 Regiones as a medium of information. This suggests the project began at least by late 2022 and has been marketed as a regional information/music service. ([zeno.fm](https://zeno.fm/radio/contacto-4-regiones/))
- Directory listings since then frame the station as a newer internet radio offering that blends music with news and regional capsules, emphasizing a four-region coverage concept around San Luis Potosí (Region Media, Altiplano, Huasteca, Centro). This is reflected in MyTuner’s description and the regional focus noted across listings. ([mytuner-radio.com](https://mytuner-radio.com/es/emisora/la-voz-4-regiones-492288/?utm_source=openai))

Programming and hosts
- Public pages describe a format mixing music, news, reports, and informational capsules rather than a fixed, long-running talk-host lineup. No specific hosts are publicly named on the main pages, suggesting either a rotating roster or a low-profile host setup typical of small online stations. This aligns with the “Música, Noticias, Reportajes y Cápsulas Informativas” framing seen in Zeno FM’s entry. ([zeno.fm](https://zeno.fm/radio/contacto-4-regiones/))
- The platform’s stated content type implies short-form news bites or capsules in addition to music, rather than a strict, conventional radio show schedule. This is echoed in the MyTuner listing’s phrasing about “notes informativas” and regional coverage. ([mytuner-radio.com](https://mytuner-radio.com/es/emisora/la-voz-4-regiones-492288/?utm_source=openai))

Streaming, coverage, and technical notes
- The main stream is online-only; no FM/AM frequencies are listed, with San Luis Potosí indicated as “Online.” The Radio En Vivo page shows a live player and a clickable “LIVE” interface for Contacto 4 Regiones en vivo. This confirms online streaming as the primary delivery method. ([radio-en-vivo.mx](https://www.radio-en-vivo.mx/la-voz-4-regiones))
- The station’s reach is described as regional in scope (the four-región concept) and accessible to a global audience via the internet. Directory entries reinforce this, noting online access and cross-listings on multiple aggregators (MyTuner, Zeno FM). ([mytuner-radio.com](https://mytuner-radio.com/es/emisora/la-voz-4-regiones-492288/?utm_source=openai))
- Monitoring and metadata: MyTuner specifies “Broadcast Monitoring by ACRCloud,” indicating the stream is tracked for content recognition, timing, and metadata, a common practice for online radio aggregations. ([mytuner-radio.com](https://mytuner-radio.com/es/emisora/la-voz-4-regiones-492288/?utm_source=openai))

Contact and ownership signals
- Public contact details include a phone number (4871380884) and an email (lavoz4regiones@gmail.com), which are typical for independent online stations. No corporate owner is listed in the public pages reviewed, suggesting a small, possibly community-based operation. ([radio-en-vivo.mx](https://www.radio-en-vivo.mx/la-voz-4-regiones))
- Social media presence is linked on Zeno FM, though direct access to profiles was restricted in this session; the existence of social channels is consistent with many niche web-based stations seeking local engagement. ([zeno.fm](https://zeno.fm/radio/contacto-4-regiones/))

AI Generated Content:
JUMP Radio is a Warsaw-based electronic music station whose current presentation centers on a live, online stream focused on Dance, EDM and Trance. The station is listed as online in Warsaw with the ability to reach a worldwide audience via the internet, according to the JUMP Radio page on Radio Polska and aggregators. ([radio-polska.pl](https://www.radio-polska.pl/jump-radio))

Historically, the brand has appeared in sources as Jump Radio with an FM signal in Warsaw (FM 92.9), suggesting that the station once operated on conventional FM before shifting to online streaming. Contemporary listings emphasize the online feed, with the FM reference appearing in older directory pages (e.g., Streema’s Jump Radio 929FM entry). This points to a potential FM era followed by a primarily internet-based presence in recent years. ([pt.streema.com](https://pt.streema.com/radios/Jump_Radio_929FM))

The official portal for JUMP Radio is jumpradio.net, which is cited on the station’s listing and by aggregators. The current contact channel publicly listed is studio@jumpradio.net, with the jumpradio.net site serving as the station’s main hub for streaming and information. This setup aligns with an online-first operation that relies on a central website rather than a traditional, hosted broadcast schedule. ([radio-polska.pl](https://www.radio-polska.pl/jump-radio))

In terms of programming, the JUMP Radio page emphasizes a live feed of dance-oriented tracks rather than a clearly published host lineup. On the live page you can see a stream of recent titles such as Sound Bass – Toksyna (SOUND BASS Remix), DJ Shog – Another World, and other electronic selections, indicating a rotating DJ/track-based format typical of online EDM stations. The page sections labeled “Najpopularniejsze piosenki” (top songs) and the “Zobacz więcej” link further suggest an active, continually updated playlist rather than fixed talk-shows. ([radio-polska.pl](https://www.radio-polska.pl/jump-radio))

The site’s playlist highlights underscore the station’s contemporary EDM orientation. Recent seven- and 30-day top tracks include names like Sonny Fodera, Kryder, Swedish House Mafia, EDX, and Stereopole among others, illustrating a mix of high-energy club cuts and crossover dance tracks that are common to European EDM stations. This supports the station’s branding as a dance/EDM hub rather than a personality-driven talk station. ([radio-polska.pl](https://www.radio-polska.pl/jump-radio))

Coverage and availability are straightforward: JUMP Radio is listed with Warsaw online as the primary “frequency,” meaning it is an internet stream accessible from anywhere with a connection. The listing confirms that the station’s availability is online-only in its current configuration, rather than a traditional FM broadcast in Warsaw. ([radio-polska.pl](https://www.radio-polska.pl/jump-radio))

No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
Xodó FM is a Sergipe-based radio network branding itself as “A Rádio do Seu Coração.” The Cristinápolis outlet broadcasts on 90.7 FM, and the same brand lockstep operates other frequencies around the state, including Estância (101.5 FM, per local listings) and Aracaju (89.9 FM), among others. The network’s multiple transmitters and shared branding indicate a regional chain rather than a single local station, a pattern you can verify across the state listings and aggregators. ([radios-brasil.com](https://radios-brasil.com/6813-xodo-fm.html?utm_source=openai))

History and structure: Xodó FM appears to have launched as a network around 2016, expanding through several studios under a common corporate umbrella. The Mobile/IoT app stores describe “Estúdios Reunidos” (Estúdio A in Nossa Senhora do Socorro, Estúdio B in Aracaju, Estúdio C in Nossa Senhora da Glória), underscoring a multi-studio, multi-city operation. This infrastructure aligns with the network’s spread across Sergipe and its ongoing app presence in 2025. ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/rede-xod%C3%B3/id1659698634?utm_source=openai))

Programming and hosts: Detailed host lineups are not consistently published in the readily accessible pages; however, the network’s listings and regional pages suggest an eclectic musical format, with variations by city. Aracaju’s Xodó FM pages (for the 89.9 FM outlet) describe an ecletic mix, while Cristinápolis’ local listing identifies the station as serving Sertanejo and related Brazilian popular music. This pattern—eclectic/varied playlists with strong regional flavor—appears common across the Xodó FM system. For current show names and hosts, the official site and social channels are the best sources. ([cxradio.com.br](https://www.cxradio.com.br/radio/xodo-fm-aracaju?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and coverage notes: The Cristinápolis feed (90.7 FM) is accessible via several streaming aggregators, and a live page on radio-ao-vivo presents Xodó FM Cristinápolis ao vivo, confirming the station’s online presence beyond the terrestrial FM signal. The official site is xodofm.com.br, which is referenced across multiple listings. Additional platforms like MyTuner and OpenRadio broadcast or index the Xodó FM Estância and Cristinápolis feeds, indicating broad digital coverage for listeners abroad, including the US. ([radio-ao-vivo.com](https://www.radio-ao-vivo.com/xodo-fm-estancia?utm_source=openai))

Community and activities: Xodó FM appears engaged in local education initiatives through partnerships with state programs. A SEED (Secretaria de Educação de Sergipe) piece notes the Xodó FM team promoting the “Projeto Foca na Educação,” illustrating the network’s involvement in youth media training and community outreach. This aligns with the broader regional role many Sergipe stations seek in local civic life. ([seduc.se.gov.br](https://seduc.se.gov.br/radio-xodo-fm-fala-da-importancia-do-projeto-foca-na-educacao/?utm_source=openai))

Notes for listeners in the US: If you’re tuning in from overseas, verify live streams via the main outlet pages (xodofm.com.br) or trusted aggregators (MyTuner, OpenRadio) to confirm current streams and schedules, since local programming can change. The network’s presence on multiple platforms helps ensure a stable feed despite regional bandwidth variations. ([radios-brasil.com](https://radios-brasil.com/6813-xodo-fm.html?utm_source=openai))

No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
La Que Te Gusta is a Colombian radio brand whose public presence centers on a local 100.5 FM
signal serving Becerril (Cesar Department) and a modest online footprint. The Emisoras
Colombianas directory lists the station as La que te gusta en vivo with 24 hours of
programming and identifies the Becerril frequency as 100.5 FM, plus a website at laquetegusta.com. The station’s own site confirms the brand and provides social links. ([emisorascolombianas.co](https://www.emisorascolombianas.co/la-que-te-gusta))

The Emisoras Colombianas entry further describes the station as “24 horas de buena programación” in the Variety category, reinforcing the impression of a lightweight, all-day music-and-mix format aimed at a broad audience. The site shows a contact email and phone number, and notes a web presence (laquetegusta.com). The 2025 copyright on La Que Te Gusta’s site suggests active operation in 2025, though no formal founding date or corporate owner is published publicly. ShockMEDIA Colombia is credited for the site design, a clue about the station’s online presentation rather than ownership. ([emisorascolombianas.co](https://www.emisorascolombianas.co/la-que-te-gusta))

Programming and branding are consistently described as Variety with a 24/7 music focus; the station appears to emphasize broad, accessible fare over a tightly defined genre. Public listings do not reveal named hosts or signature programs, which is common for smaller local or community-oriented stations that rely on rotating on-air talent rather than a marquee lineup. The Emisoras page explicitly does not list hosts in the visible metadata. ([emisorascolombianas.co](https://www.emisorascolombianas.co/la-que-te-gusta))

Streaming and coverage notes are modest but clear. The Emisoras Colombianas entry provides a “LIVE” link, identifying La Que Te Gusta as a live, around-the-clock station, and lists a direct website (laquetegusta.com) for streaming. The site’s mobile-compatibility and presence on social networks are indicated in the directory, while app icons on the Emisoras page suggest listener access via Android and iOS platforms via the directory’s app launcher. Location data in aggregators is inconsistent: Becerril is listed as the frequency’s city, while TuneIn aggregates sometimes place the station in San Juan del Cesar, another town in Cesar Department. This discrepancy is not uncommon for small signals with regional reach. ([emisorascolombianas.co](https://www.emisorascolombianas.co/la-que-te-gusta))

In short, La Que Te Gusta appears to be a small, locally focused Colombian station built around a 24/7 music-and-variety format, centered on 100.5 FM in Becerril, with a digital footprint via laquetegusta.com and presence in radio directories. Its public-facing materials emphasize accessibility and broad programming rather than a fixed lineup or high-profile hosts. The exact ownership and founding date remain undocumented in readily accessible public records; the 2025 site copyright and design credits provide a snapshot of its current online branding rather than corporate history.

AI Generated Content:
mx Coahuila Radio y Televisión is the public radio–television broadcaster for the State of Coahuila, Mexico. The radio network operates across 16 FM transmitters, while the television service is centered in Saltillo on XHPBSA-TDT channel 17. The agency is an arm of the state government (Coahuila Radio y Televisión) and its studios/controls are co-located with the radio operation in Saltillo. This arrangement links radio and TV under one state-run public media umbrella. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coahuila_Radio?utm_source=openai))

History and organization
The state’s public-radio network began as a formal government entity on February 28, 2014, when Radio Coahuila was constituted as a separate government agency. On March 8, 2019, a decree renamed the agency to Coahuila Radio y Televisión, signaling the integration of the TV service with the existing radio network (and the forthcoming TV outlet). The TV component, XHPBSA-TDT (Saltillo) later joined the network as its television service, launching in January 2020. The restructuring and launch timeline are documented in official records and summaries of the network’s evolution. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coahuila_Radio?utm_source=openai))

Coverage and transmitters
Coahuila Radio y Televisión distributes programming statewide via 16 FM transmitters. The Saltillo flagship is XHSOC-FM at 89.7, with additional frequencies in other cities such as Monclova (102.7), Piedras Negras (102.5), Minas de Barroterán (94.3), and more, reflecting the network’s broad public-service reach across Coahuila. The TV arm operates alongside the radio with the Saltillo TV outlet on channel 17. The public-network model emphasizes state-wide information, culture, and public affairs through both radio and TV facilities. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coahuila_Radio?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and online presence
Even though the station’s landing pages emphasize frequencies and contact details, Coahuila Radio y Televisión maintains online streaming presence. The live stream is accessible via aggregators such as radio-en-vivo.mx, which lists Coahuila Radio y Televisión and its regional frequencies; the site also links to the state’s TV and radio sites (coahuilartv.com.mx and radiocoahuila.com.mx). The public-facing pages reinforce that the network serves as a state-run information and culture channel, with streaming options and contact information available for listeners/viewers. ([radio-en-vivo.mx](https://www.radio-en-vivo.mx/coahuila-radio-y-television?utm_source=openai))

Notes on programming and hosts
As a state public broadcaster, Coahuila Radio y Televisión concentrates on cultural programming, regional news, and public-information content designed to reflect Coahuila’s identity and civic life. Individual program schedules and host lineups are not consistently published in widely accessible pages, which is common for many public networks that operate across multiple transmitters and a TV channel. The available sources focus on structure, coverage, and official channels rather than publishing detailed show rosters.

No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
RPR1 is a private radio service based in Rheinland-Pfalz that has long branded itself as the region’s friendly “AC” music mix. It began broadcasting on 30 April 1986 as one of the earliest landwide privates in the state, operated by Rheinland-Pfälzische Rundfunk GmbH & Co. KG. In late 2020/2021 the four-station group Audiotainment Südwest formed a central production company, but RPR1 kept its own brand and core format. Current MA 2025 Audio II figures show a daily reach of about 1.317 million listeners and around 2.131 million online audio sessions per month, reflecting strong regional engagement. ([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPR1))

Notable on-air talent and programs have helped define RPR1’s character. The station markets a Guten Morgen Rheinland-Pfalz with Ben Salzner and Solin, a daily morning pair, plus daytime shows such as Topthemen am Mittag and Der Tag in Rheinland-Pfalz, and evening/morning hosts like Selina Schmitt, Tobias Gebhard, Daniel Kaiser, and Miriam Audrey Hannah. Comedic and specialty segments have featured Sven Hieronymus (RPR1. Rockertreff), Bob Murawka (Musikclub, Samstag XXL), Uwe Burkert (Einfach Himmlisch), Reiner Meutsch (Mein Abenteuer), and Handwerker Peters, who in 2024 was voted Comedystar von Rheinland-Pfalz. These lineups illustrate a mix of music, local news, and light entertainment that has been a hallmark of the station. ([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPR1))

RPR1’s festival footprint is anchored in Mainz. The Rhine­land-Pfalz Open Air, run by RPR1 and partners, spanned 2005–2014 and became a signature free-entry open-air event in Mainz’ Regierungsviertel. The 2014 edition celebrated its tenth anniversary with a line-up that included Cro, Alligatoah, Kim Wilde, and Rea Garvey, and featured government officials praising the festival’s role in regional culture. This event line underscores RPR1’s historically strong live-music presence beyond the studio. ([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPR1))

Streaming and coverage notes. RPR1 broadcasts around the clock with webradio today, and since October 27, 2017 has been carried digitally via DAB+ (the service also expanded into Saarland on 9C from May 1, 2024). The RPR1 app offers access to more than 30 streams and a variety of podcasts, extending reach beyond the FM/DAB footprint. A linked page such as the InternetRadio-Horen “RPR1. Festival” stream illustrates how the brand’s festival mood travels to aggregators, though it is not an official RPR1 site. ([de.wikipedia.org](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPR1))

Summary: RPR1 remains a central, long-running AX program in Rhineland-Palatinate, with a rich festival heritage (notably Mainz Open Air), a stable stable of hosts and formats that blend music, news, and humor, and multi-channel streaming coverage that includes modern apps and DAB+. The linked festival stream reflects the label’s continued association with live-event energy, even as the core operation sits within Audiotainment Südwest.

AI Generated Content:
CBC Radio One is the English-language public radio network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). It originated as CBC Radio in 1936, part of the Trans-Canada Network; the Dominion Network operated separately from 1944 until its dissolution in 1962, after which CBC consolidated into a single Radio One service. The FM network that carried CBC Radio in major markets was rebranded CBC Stereo in 1975, and the national network adopted the CBC Radio One identity in 1997. The network is commercial-free and available across Canada on AM/FM, with online streaming available worldwide. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One?utm_source=openai))

Notable programs and hosts
- The Current: CBC’s flagship morning current affairs program, launched in 2002 and originally hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti. Tremonti remained the host until 2019; Matt Galloway has been the permanent host since January 6, 2020. The show blends interviews, features, and long-form pieces. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Current_%28radio_program%29?utm_source=openai))
- As It Happens: A long-running CBC evening interview program that began in 1968. It features CBC journalists conducting interviews with newsmakers; as of 2022, Nil Köksal has been the host, with Chris Howden serving as co-host since 2020. The program has been a cornerstone of CBC Radio One’s current affairs lineup. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_It_Happens?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and coverage notes
- CBC Radio One is widely available over the air, and its national and local programs are distributed via the CBC Listen app and CBC.ca/listen, enabling live streaming and on-demand access for listeners outside traditional broadcast ranges. The Apple CBC Listen app page highlights live streams and CBC podcasts as core features. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One?utm_source=openai))
- The user-provided link (La Radio de Radio Canada) is a third-party directory/listing that aggregates CBC Radio One content with a link to CBC’s official site (cbc.ca/radio). It confirms CBC Radio One – live as a listing option and provides a CBC site reference. ([canadaradiostations.com](https://www.canadaradiostations.com/la-radio-de-radio-canada))

Nearby history and context
- The CBC’s network structure historically included the Trans-Canada Network and the Dominion Network; their consolidation in 1962 and the later evolution to the CBC Radio One brand shaped how local and national programming were scheduled, with a strong emphasis on news, analysis, documentaries, and public affairs. This evolution is documented in CBC history references and standard program guides. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One?utm_source=openai))

Streaming/coverage addendum
- The CBC Listen app is available on iOS and Android, and CBC’s streaming offerings continue to emphasize live listen and on-demand content, including long-running CBC programs as part of its public-service mission.

AI Generated Content:
CBC Radio One is the English-language public radio network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). It originated as CBC Radio in 1936, part of the Trans-Canada Network; the Dominion Network operated separately from 1944 until its dissolution in 1962, after which CBC consolidated into a single Radio One service. The FM network that carried CBC Radio in major markets was rebranded CBC Stereo in 1975, and the national network adopted the CBC Radio One identity in 1997. The network is commercial-free and available across Canada on AM/FM, with online streaming available worldwide. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One?utm_source=openai))

Notable programs and hosts
- The Current: CBC’s flagship morning current affairs program, launched in 2002 and originally hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti. Tremonti remained the host until 2019; Matt Galloway has been the permanent host since January 6, 2020. The show blends interviews, features, and long-form pieces. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Current_%28radio_program%29?utm_source=openai))
- As It Happens: A long-running CBC evening interview program that began in 1968. It features CBC journalists conducting interviews with newsmakers; as of 2022, Nil Köksal has been the host, with Chris Howden serving as co-host since 2020. The program has been a cornerstone of CBC Radio One’s current affairs lineup. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_It_Happens?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and coverage notes
- CBC Radio One is widely available over the air, and its national and local programs are distributed via the CBC Listen app and CBC.ca/listen, enabling live streaming and on-demand access for listeners outside traditional broadcast ranges. The Apple CBC Listen app page highlights live streams and CBC podcasts as core features. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One?utm_source=openai))
- The user-provided link (La Radio de Radio Canada) is a third-party directory/listing that aggregates CBC Radio One content with a link to CBC’s official site (cbc.ca/radio). It confirms CBC Radio One – live as a listing option and provides a CBC site reference. ([canadaradiostations.com](https://www.canadaradiostations.com/la-radio-de-radio-canada))

Nearby history and context
- The CBC’s network structure historically included the Trans-Canada Network and the Dominion Network; their consolidation in 1962 and the later evolution to the CBC Radio One brand shaped how local and national programming were scheduled, with a strong emphasis on news, analysis, documentaries, and public affairs. This evolution is documented in CBC history references and standard program guides. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One?utm_source=openai))

Streaming/coverage addendum
- The CBC Listen app is available on iOS and Android, and CBC’s streaming offerings continue to emphasize live listen and on-demand content, including long-running CBC programs as part of its public-service mission.

Rádio Krokodýl FM
 
No program information and image

AI Generated Content:
Rádio Krokodýl FM is Brno’s longstanding regional radio, branding itself as the
most-listened regional station in the Czech Republic and a Brno‑core station for
south Moravia. The outlet has been on air since 1994 and emphasizes a broad music
mix with a regional news and traffic footprint to match its audience in Brno and
surrounding towns. ([krokodyl.cz](https://www.krokodyl.cz/o-nas))

Coverage and reach are central to its identity. The station operates on 13 FM
frequencies across Brno and nearby counties and Vysočina, including Brno 103.0 FM,
Vyškov 102.6, Hodonín 95.4, Břeclav 99.1, Znojmo 96.2, Boskovice 91.9, Žďár nad Sázavou
96.0, Velké Meziříčí 89.1, Třebíč 101.7, Jihlava 102.3, Svitavy 96.3, Dačice 98.5 and more,
with a coverage map published on the site. This breadth underpins its claim of being
the region’s premier local outlet. ([krokodyl.cz](https://www.krokodyl.cz/mapa-pokryti))

Ownership and licensing are explicit in industry references. The licence is listed as
held by Nonstop, s.r.o., with a start date of 30 July 1999 and a traditional licence
extension (compensation licence) through 2025, indicating the station’s continued legal
operation in the Czech radio ecosystem. ([radiotv.cz](https://www.radiotv.cz/radio/radio-krokodyl/))

Notable shows and on‑air talent define the listening experience. The current on‑air team
includes Jarek Hemala (Noční Expres) overnight, and daytime majors such as Honza Kolařík
(To Nejlepší Po Ránu / Devadesátky v devět), Tonda Kala (Hit za hitem), Jirka Wiener
(Hity na přání / Hity mého života), Petr Holík (Odpolední show), Jana Houbová, and
Martin Sláma, among others. The station highlights a strong mix of singer‑songwriter and
pop formats, with a hit‑oriented rotation designed to keep Brno’s listeners engaged. ([krokodyl.cz](https://www.krokodyl.cz/moderatori))

Streaming and online presence complement the FM signal. The program page advertises a live
stream with a “spustit živě” option via listen.play.cz, and the site confirms internet
streaming of Rádio Krokodýl, alongside its 13‑frequency FM footprint. The station also
hosts ongoing hitparades and regular program schedules, underscoring its multi‑platform
presence. ([agent.krokodyl.cz](https://agent.krokodyl.cz/program/))

In sum, Rádio Krokodýl FM remains a Brno‑centered regional radio with a long history, a
broad transmitter footprint across southern Moravia and Vysočina, a stable on‑air host
lineup, and a robust online streaming option that sustains its local identity into the
2020s. It continues to publish updated programming and news relevant to Brno and nearby
communities, confirming its status as a staple of the region’s radio landscape. ([krokodyl.cz](https://www.krokodyl.cz/o-nas))

LIVE

AI Generated Content:
101.3 MLR Radio FM appears to be a small, independent online Filipino-language station branding itself as “Ang radyo ng masa.” Its public footprint centers on online streaming rather than a major FM broadcast. The Radio Philippines directory lists the station as frequency 101.3 MLR Radio FM with Manila as the online locale, and provides a Website link to 1013mlrradiofm.weebly.com, plus a phone number and an email for contact. This points to a modest operation focused on web streaming rather than a wide terrestrial signal. ([radio-philippines.com](https://www.radio-philippines.com/1013-mlr-radio-fm?utm_source=openai))

The station’s own site, hosted on Weebly, confirms a compact setup: sections labeled MLR STAFFS, DJ ONBOARD, LIVE LISTENERS, and a “LIVE” indicator, together with a host label “HORNHOST.” The page also shows a placeholder or roster-like area and a line for “Djheart Ko Vergara,” suggesting a local DJ identity or signature element but not a public, published roster of hosts. The presence of a live feed and “EVENT BANNERS” hints at a basic, community-oriented operation rather than a large network. ([1013mlrradiofm.weebly.com](https://1013mlrradiofm.weebly.com/))

In terms of shows and hosts, public documentation does not reveal a formal roster of named programs or DJs beyond the site’s generic labels. The lack of a published schedule or multiple host profiles is typical of small online radio ventures, where talent can rotate or appear as guest DJs. The directory’s listing of a single contact email (djguest2021@gmail.com) reinforces the notion of an informal, perhaps guest-driven lineup rather than a professionally marketed lineup. ([radio-philippines.com](https://www.radio-philippines.com/1013-mlr-radio-fm))

Streaming and coverage notes: The Radio Philippines page specifies a website link (1013mlrradiofm.weebly.com) and lists a Manila-based online presence, indicating the station’s reach is via internet streaming. The Weebly page shows a “LIVE” indicator and “LIVE LISTENERS,” reinforcing its online-only model. The absence of concrete FM transmitter data in public records is consistent with a small, web-first operation rather than a stable terrestrial footprint. For listeners, the primary access remains the online stream, with the directory offering app download prompts typical of aggregator listings. ([radio-philippines.com](https://www.radio-philippines.com/1013-mlr-radio-fm?utm_source=openai))

Overall, 101.3 MLR Radio FM is best described as a niche, online radio project operating under a simple branding—focused on “the masses” with likely local, rotating DJ involvement and a minimal public-facing roster. Current publicly available sources emphasize its online stream, a small website presence, and basic contact channels rather than a formally documented history or a catalog of notable shows/hosts. ([1013mlrradiofm.weebly.com](https://1013mlrradiofm.weebly.com/))

Feature | Description
Platform | Online streaming from Manila; public listings show a Manila: Online tag and a Weebly-hosted site for the stream.
Launch date | No publicly published launch date; public references suggest activity around 2021 via the contact email.
Hosts/Shows | No published host roster; site uses generic labels like DJ ONBOARD and HORNHOST, with a single DJ signature line.
Coverage/Reach | Streaming-focused; no confirmed terrestrial transmitter details; marketed as Ang radyo ng masa.

AI Generated Content:
CaboRadio is an online Cape Verdean music station that streams continuously and centers on kizomba, morna, funana, coladeira, cabo love and zouk. The main streaming site is CaboRadio.fr, and the station is listed as “CaboRadio live” with a CaboRadio Emocão/Kizomba identity across aggregators such as fmradiofree.com/cabo-radio. The page also shows a current live slate and recent tracks, confirming active, real‑time broadcasting. ([caboradio.wixsite.com](https://caboradio.wixsite.com/caboradio/en/caboman))

Origins and ownership: CaboRadio appears to be run by CaBoMaN, a Paris-based promoter of Cabo Verdean music. The CaboRadio.fr site identifies CaBoMaN as the driving force, and the Wix biography confirms his long-standing involvement in Cabo Verdean music, noting he created Cabo-site.com (2001–2013) and then focused on CaboRadio.fr, which has been streaming since 2014. This places the station’s active online presence at roughly 2014 onward, with CaBoMaN as the principal organizer. ([caboradio.wixsite.com](https://caboradio.wixsite.com/caboradio/en/caboman))

Programming and notable shows: The Wix “Programme radio” page lays out a weekly cadence: Segunda-Feira (Mon) Kizomba; Terça-Feira (Tue) Funana; Quarta-Feira (Wed) Hip Hop; Quinta-Feira (Thu) Afro & DJ; Sabado (Sat) Cabo Love / Cabo Zouk; Domingo (Sun) Morna / Coladeira. This pattern indicates a rotating, genre-focused schedule that mirrors Cape Verdean musical culture for a global audience. The site also features blocks such as Proxima Musica and Lembra Tempo, with names and imagery (e.g., Lonny J) suggesting rotating DJs or hosts and a diaspora-influenced lineup. ([caboradio.wixsite.com](https://caboradio.wixsite.com/caboradio/programme-radio))

Notable hosts and artists: The CaboRadio pages show a rotating roster of DJs and performers rather than a single long-running morning show. The CaBoMaN site gallery includes entries like Lonny J and Morabeza Pilax, and the Proxima Musica/Lembra Tempo sections point to themed programming and guest appearances. The presence of Lonny J in the visual roster supports a rotating-host model common to online Cape Verdean stations. ([caboradio.wixsite.com](https://caboradio.wixsite.com/caboradio/en/caboman))

Streaming and coverage notes: CaboRadio’s live stream is clearly identified on the official site as a continuous broadcast, with a visible “LIVE” banner and current selections (e.g., Presteej, Nelson Freitas, Djodje) on the fmradiofree listing, demonstrating an active, current playlist and regular updates. Additional aggregators (MyTuner, Radio.fr, Radio.net, etc.) consistently list CaboRadio.fr as the official site and categorize it under African/Cape Verdean music, indicating broad, cross‑platform reach beyond a single portal. ([fmradiofree.com](https://www.fmradiofree.com/cabo-radio))

He Is Able - Greatest Praise Songs CD - Noland-Ferguson (ASCAP) - Track14
LIVE

AI Generated Content:
Home Coming Gospel is an internet radio stream cataloged on fmradiofree’s “Home Coming Gospel live” page. The stream is shown as LIVE and features a rotating playlist of gospel tracks, with a public Top Songs list that includes hymns and Gospel-Southern selections (e.g., Maranatha instrumental pieces, Dave Cleveland, Babbie Mason). The page does not publish a traditional host or show lineup; it presents the channel as a continuous music stream rather than a host-led program. ([fmradiofree.com](https://www.fmradiofree.com/home-coming-gospel))

Ownership and structure notes are limited publicly. The fmradiofree listing places Home Coming Gospel under its catalog of US radio streams and explicitly notes a website link labeled homecominggospel.com as the “Contact/Website” for the stream. The fmradiofree site itself is described as part of AppMind’s Radio US network, which centralizes access to thousands of stations and podcasts rather than operating as a standalone FCC-licensed station. This suggests Home Coming Gospel is an internet- streamer rather than a terrestrial station with local licensure. ([fmradiofree.com](https://www.fmradiofree.com/about-us?utm_source=openai))

Public-facing site status for homecominggospel.com is murkier. The linked domain appears to have existed since 2011 (registered via GoDaddy; owner listed as a typical small hosting setup) but, in late 2025, attempts to load the site in this environment often fail or show the domain as offline or inaccessible. A third-party checker flagged the site as offline as of November 2025, and a separate attempt to load the domain returned a 406 Not Acceptable error in this environment, underscoring limited public-facing information about a live flagship site. This lack of accessible, canonical source makes it hard to confirm a fixed on-air identity beyond the streaming page. ([webrate.org](https://webrate.org/site/homecominggospel.com/?utm_source=openai))

A useful contextual note: Home Coming Gospel should not be confused with Bill Gaither’s Homecoming Radio, a widely distributed network and set of programs that features hosts and recurring show formats. Gaither’s Homecoming Radio has clearly defined programming and is listed on stations and aggregators (e.g., TuneIn pages and radio station listings) as a separate entity from the Home Coming Gospel stream on fmradiofree. This distinction matters for anyone researching on-air personnel and long-term programming lineage. ([tunein.com](https://tunein.com/radio/Homecoming-p52992/?utm_source=openai))

Streaming/coverage notes:
- Access is via an internet-only stream listed on fmradiofree; there’s no indication of FM/AM broadcast coverage in the public materials. The Top Songs and Last 7/30 days lists indicate a playlist-driven service with a rotating set of gospel titles, not a schedule-driven show. ([fmradiofree.com](https://www.fmradiofree.com/home-coming-gospel))
- The absence of public host information and the offline status of homecominggospel.com means researchers should treat the stream as a music channel with limited public metadata, rather than a documented, host-led station with archival history. The public record thus far does not corroborate a formal founder/owner beyond the AppMind association of the host site. ([fmradiofree.com](https://www.fmradiofree.com/about-us?utm_source=openai))

AI Generated Content:
Radio Repentistas is a Brazilian online gospel station anchored in Olinda, Pernambuco. It presents itself as evangelizing through culture, with a streaming presence mainly on the web rather than a terrestrial signal. The Olinda-based identity is reinforced by listings that label the station as “Olinda: Online” and by the site radiorepentistas.com, which serves as the station’s portal for listeners. ([radios.com.br](https://www.radios.com.br/aovivo/radio-repentistas/25843?utm_source=openai))

Streaming and reach: The station is carried on online radio portals such as radio-ao-vivo, which show a live feed and current track info, confirming an active online stream. This setup makes the station accessible worldwide to listeners seeking Pentecostal/gospel programming from Brazil. ([radio-ao-vivo.com](https://www.radio-ao-vivo.com/radio-repentistas))

Format and programming: Radio Repentistas presents a Pentecostal gospel format with Brazilian music, often categorized as Gospel and Christian by listing services. The live page includes a mix of worship songs and Northeastern religious music, with tracks and artists visible in the current stream (e.g., Xote Santo, Gioia Junior, Nascimento & Silva). This suggests a programming mix that blends contemporary worship with regional styles popular in Pernambuco and the broader Northeast. ([radio-ao-vivo.com](https://www.radio-ao-vivo.com/radio-repentistas))

Notable shows/hosts and content cues: Public listings and stream artifacts hint at preacher-hosted content, for example, a program or segment attributed to Pr. Jaime Campos titled “O Rei Está Voltando.” While explicit long-form show histories aren’t widely published, such host-led pieces are consistent with Pentecostal radio practice and the station’s advertised identity. The stream’s top tracks also show a pattern of Northeastern gospel styles, including “Xote Santo – Senhor do Nordeste 2.” ([radio-ao-vivo.com](https://www.radio-ao-vivo.com/radio-repentistas))

Historical notes and ownership: The exact founding date or corporate ownership of Radio Repentistas is not readily documented in widely accessible sources. Public listings confirm ongoing activity through the 2020s, the presence of contact details (radiorepentistas@gmail.com; +55 81 98515-7272), and a primary website (radiorepentistas.com). This points to a small, web-focused operation centered on Olinda with local affiliations. Public directories and aggregation pages corroborate an Olinda base and online-only distribution. ([rankeador.com.br](https://www.rankeador.com.br/radio/radio-repentistas?utm_source=openai))

Streaming/coverage notes: The station’s current listings show “Olinda: Online” as its mode of delivery, aligning with other Brazilian gospel webcasters that use Radioweb/aggregator platforms for reach. Viewers can access the stream via radiorepentistas.com and through terceros like radio-ao-vivo, Radio.net, and Radios.com.br, which broadens its potential audience beyond the local market.

Sydney Breakfast
with
Chris Taylor

AI Generated Content:
ABC Radio Sydney (call sign 2BL) is the flagship station of Australia’s ABC Local Radio network, based in Sydney and airing on AM 702 kHz. It traces its lineage to the first Australian public radio broadcast in 1923 as 2SB, later renamed 2BL, then 702, and finally rebranded ABC Radio Sydney in the 2010s. This long arc reflects the station’s evolution from parliamentary broadcasting and talks to a modern, listener-centered talk and news format. The station is owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=openai))

Origins and development
- Airdate and early history: ABC Radio Sydney began life on 23 November 1923 as 2SB, later becoming 2BL, and ultimately 702 before adopting the ABC Sydney branding. The 100-year retrospective highlights that evolution from a “talks and sermons” era to a contemporary, participatory format. ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-22/abc-radio-2bl-702-sydney-celebrates-100-years-on-air/103119034?utm_source=openai))
- Milestones: The station became the flagship of the ABC Local Radio network and, for decades, carried parliamentary broadcasts and a mix of music and discussion. Its history is commemorated in multiple ABC and industry retrospectives, including RadioInfo’s centennial piece. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_Sydney?utm_source=openai))

Current programming and personnel
- Sydney Breakfast: The morning program known as Sydney Breakfast is presented by Chris Taylor.
